# Richard Toner's Dot Files

This repository handles all of the installation and configuration required for my personal development environment on OS X.

## Installation

Using your terminal, do the following:

1.  Clone the repository in to a .dotfiles directory in your home directory: `git clone https://github.com/richardtoner/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
2.  Navigate to the .dotfiles directory: `cd ~/.dotfiles`
3.  Run the setup script: `./bin/setup.sh`

## Optionals

Some optional files that I find useful for workstation-specific commands are also documented below:

### Aliases

Add some custom aliases to `~/.dotfiles/optionals/aliases` and they will be automatically sourced when you open a new terminal window.
